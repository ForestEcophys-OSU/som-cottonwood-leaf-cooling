# Outdated Problem Formats

We did not take the time to convert the problems over to the new sa.py format. To utilize all of these problems for sensitivity analysis, either for reproduction or other experimentation, either convert these to the new sa-problem-example.json format in sa_problems, or use this with the old_sa.py file.
